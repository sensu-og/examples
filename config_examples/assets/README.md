# Assets

If you're not already familiar with assets, it's strongly recommended that you read the [Asset Reference Documentation][1]. 

While asset examples are useful, it's worth noting that the preferred way of adding an asset to your Sensu deployment is through the use of `sensuctl asset add $BONSAINAMESPACE/$ASSETNAME` 

This portion of the project will use examples following the above convention.

## Check Assets

## Filter Assets

## Mutator Assets
